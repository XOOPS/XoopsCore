 * Yaml dump and parse methods
 *
 * YAML is a serialization format most useful when human readability
 * is a consideration. It can be useful for configuration files, as
 * well as import and export functions.
 *
 * This file is a front end for a separate YAML package present in the
 * vendor directory. The intent is to provide a consistent interface
 * no mater what underlying library is actually used.
 *
 * At present, this class expects the symfony/yaml package.
