v0.2.2
- requires are now resolved relative to base phpsecinfo path, so PhpSecInfo does
  not need to be in php's include path
- allow_url_fopen now will not throw a warning if enabled and PHP version >= 5.2
- Added simple View system; moved HTML views out of PhpSecInfo class.  You can
  use PhpSecInfo->setViewDirectory($path) to set the path to your own custom
  views (your view files need to mirror the structure of the default views).
- Added cli, CSV, JSON and RSS views
- Added examples directory to demonstrate more advanced usage of views system
- PHPSecInfo_Test::getUnixId() now handles failure better and tries alternate
  methods before giving up
- Minor CSS fixes in HTML view <Thomas Corbiere>

v0.2.1
- uid and gid tests now correctly test the user and group that PHP is executing as
  (requires that exec() or posix functions are enabled)
- Changed upload_max_filesize and post_max_size return "OK" if current value is
  equal to recommended value
- fixed nonstandard naming with a couple locally used constants
- fixed problem with XHTML validity in cases of not run tests <Thomas Corbiere>

v0.2.0
- Changes to output code to avoid licensing problems with PHP (CSS was derived code)
- New test: PhpSecInfo_Test_Session_Save_Path <Thomas Corbiere>
- API changes!  Read the API docs if you're a test developer, and ask questions on the
  mailing list.
- rewrote all tests to adapt to API changes (displaying and use current and recommended
  settings in tests)
- Added display of "current" and "recommended" settings in test result output
- Added link to "more info" in output (see Test::getMoreInfoURL)
- Modified CSS to improve readability
- added Test::getMoreInfoURL() to generate link to detailed info on external site
- added PHPSECINFO_TEST_MOREINFO_BASEURL and set to
  http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/tests/
- Changed Test_Curl::isTestable() to use extension_loaded.  (Thx Thomas Corbiere)
- Changed Test_CGI::isTestable() to use strpos() instead of preg_match() (Thx Thomas Corbiere)
- Added isTestable() checks for magic_quotes_gpc and register_globals where
  tests are not executed if PHP_VERSION >= 6 (Thx Thomas Corbiere)
- Fixed bug in use_trans_sid.php where parent::_setMessages() wasn't being called.
  (Thx Thomas Corbiere)
- Fixed bug in SVN version Test_CGI.php where searching for 'php' instead of 'cgi' in
  sapi output (what the hell was I thinking? Thx Thomas Corbiere)
- Fixed potential redeclare weirdness in PhpSecInfo::renderOutput() with PHP5
- added meta tag to output telling compliant search engines to not index the page
- Added PhpSecInfo_Test::setTestGroup
- Fixed memory_limit test to properly report if the option has not been enabled
  at compile time
- Added PhpSecInfo_Test::osIsWindows() for checking the OS
- Fixed NOTICE for undefined string offset in returnBytes when input is 0
- Fixed NOTICE for undefined offset in table output where $test_results['moreinfo_url']
  is not set



v0.1.2
- Code is now licensed under "New BSD" license.  See LICENSE
- Added PhpSecInfo_Test_Core_Allow_Url_Include to test for allow_url_include in PHP5.2 and
  above
- fix bug in post_max_size check where upload_max_size value was being checked
- change curl file_support test to recommend upgrading to newest version of PHP
  rather than disabling support in cURL for 'file://' protocol
- removed =& calls that force pass by reference in PHP4, so as to not throw PHP5 STRICT notices.
  It means passing objects by value in PHP4, but this seems acceptable for our purposes (memory
  usage isn't terribly high).
- Fixed bug in PhpSecInfo_Test_Session_Use_Trans_Sid where wrong ini key was requested
  (Thanks Mark Wallert)

v0.1.1a
- fix bug in phpsecinfo() where debugging code was left in release.  ugh.
- modified test result output to include text version of result type.  Color-only results
  don't work in text-based browsers or cases where browser is overriding styles.

v0.1.1
- Added PhpSecInfo::getOutput(), PhpSecInfo::loadAndRun() and PhpSecInfo::getResultsAsArray()
  methods
- Modified PhpSecInfo::runTests() to fix undefined offset notices
- Modified PhpSecInfo_Test::setMessageForResult() to fix undefined offset notices
- Modified PhpSecInfo_Test_Curl_File_Support to skip if PHP version is < 5 (detection of
  file protocol support relies on PHP5 version of curl_version)

v0.1
- Initial public release
