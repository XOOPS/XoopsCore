<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Logger is an implementation of the legacy XOOPS logger, an error reporting and performance analysis tool. It attaches to the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/3/" target="_blank">PSR-3</a> compatible Xoops Logger interface.
</p>
<h4>Preferences</h4>
<p>
    The Logger preferences establish the default settings for the legacy logger. The options are:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Legacy Logger</strong> - enable the logger display</li>
        <li><strong>Use Popup Window</strong> - use a pop up window for the logger display</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Smarty Debug</strong> - displays Smarty debug information in a popup window.</li>
    </ul>

    These settings are the system defaults. Authorized users can set their individual preferences in User Configs, if it is installed.
</p>
<h4>Permissions</h4>
<p>
    Permission to use the Logger is established by XOOPS Groups. Select the groups which can use the Logger. Be aware that there are security implications to revealing the system details that can be contained in the logs.
</p>
<h4>Smarty Debug</h4>
<p>
     Additional information is available by using the <em>Enable Smarty Debug</em> option. This information is also available if the Logger is enabled by including a "SMARTY_DEBUG" (case sensitive) named variable in the page url (i.e. index.php?SMARTY_DEBUG)
