<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Avatars are small graphics or pictures that can be used in various content settings around the site. They are often used next to a user name to add a bit of "visual identification." Typical applications are in a forum or comments area.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Gravatars extension integrates avatars managed through <a href="http://gravatar.com">gravatar.com</a> with XOOPS. Users can register with gravatar.com and upload their own images there. That account is associated the email address they provide. The gravatar is used by many sites, giving the user a consitent avatar presence across many sites without needed to manage each site individually.

<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>
    The Gravatars extension installs like any other XOOPS extension. Only one avatar supplier can be used in XOOPS system, so if you are installing Gravatars, be sure to uninstall any other avatar module or extension, such as the Avatars module.
