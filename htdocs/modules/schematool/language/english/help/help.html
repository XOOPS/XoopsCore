<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    With the implementation of the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html" target="_blank">Doctrine Database Abstraction Layer</a> in XOOPS 2.6.0, all database interactions in XOOPS moved to a new level of isolation from the underlying database engine. One consequence of that abstraction is that the traditional SQL files used to create tables are now a limitation. While queries written in SQL are largely portable if the database adheres to standards, DDL (data definition language) used to create tables and indexes varies by vendor and even product. To solve this limitation, 2.6.0 implemented schema management through Doctrine. <em>Schema Tool</em> is a tool to create portable schema definitions for a module directly from the database.
    <br /><br />
    Schemas are stored in a YAML format, keeping them more human readable. Still they are verbose, so creating them automatically is recommended. During development, it is typical for developers to use database specific tools (such as phpMyAdmin) to prototype and refine tables and indexes, and then export SQL files from a live database using those tools to add to the module. Schema Tool uses this same workflow.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
    On entry, <em>Schema Tool</em> will present a list of all module installed in the current system. Select a module, and choose Submit.
    <br /><br />
    The <em>Schema Tool</em> uses the module's <b>$modversion['tables']</b> list to extract the schema definitions just for the selected module from the active database. 
    <br /><br />
    The schema definiton will be displayed and can then be downloaded.
    <br /><br />
    By convention, the file is named <b>schema.yml</b> and is stored in the module's sql directory.
    <br /><br />
    Add this line to your <em>xoops_version.php</em> to use the schema file:
    <pre>
        $modversion['schema'] = 'sql/schema.yml';
    </pre>
    When specified, the schema file will be used to install the module, overriding the legacy 'sqlfile' definitions.
