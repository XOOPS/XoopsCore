/**
 * Naming conventions
 * - All translations must be enclosed with ""
 * - All translations must be Uppercase first, do not use CamelCase
 *   Good ex: "User groups"
 *   Bad ex: "user groups" or "User Groups"
 * - All keys must be as descriptive as possible.
 * - All keys must use complete words between each '_',
 * - Keys should be prepended with identifiers in following cases:
 *   F_ Formatted, use this when strings are parsed with sprintf()
 *   A_ Action, use this when using a single word which is a verb
 *   S_ Success, use this for success messages and exclamations
 *   E_ Error, use this for error messages
 *   C_ Colon, use this when string ends with a colon ":"
 *   Q_ Question, use this when string is a question
 *   L_ List, use this for lists of strings, ex: months, countries, languages, etc
 *      Use L_NAME_ to group list items by name, ex: L_COUNTRY_
 * - Chain keys alphabetically with the exception of F, F always comes in last
 *   ex: SF_ (formatted success message), EF_ (formatted error message)
 * - Special cases:
 *   CONF_ Configs, prepend this for your module configs.
 *      Config keys are stored in database, try to make them as short as possible!
 *   _DESC Description, append this for configs description
