/**
 * Inserts the URL of a file resource customizable by themes
 *
 * This plug-in works like the {@link smarty_compiler_xoAppUrl() xoAppUrl} plug-in,
 * except that it is intended to generate the URL of resource files customizable by
 * themes.
 *
 * Here the current theme is asked to check if a custom version of the requested file exists, and
 * if one is found its URL is returned. Otherwise, the request will be passed to the
 * theme parents one by one. Ultimately, if no custom version has been found, the resource
 * default URL location will be returned.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> the themes inheritance system can generate many filesystem accesses depending
 * on your themes configuration. Because of this, the use of the dynamic syntax with this plug-in
 * is not possible right now.
